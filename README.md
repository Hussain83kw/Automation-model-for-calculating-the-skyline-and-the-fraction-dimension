# Automation-model-for-calculating-the-skyline-and-the-fraction-dimension
The codes function to calculate the skyline and extract the fractal dimension calculation, along with outputs such as graphs and processed images, a model for classifying the level of skyline complexity, and the level of visual pollution based on the fractal dimension range.
